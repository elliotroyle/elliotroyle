# Hello! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

## 👨‍🦱 About me (he/him)

I'm an experienced NHS analyst currently working for the [NHS Transformation Unit](https://transformationunit.nhs.uk/). I'm passionate about using data to drive positive changes in healthcare. This involves empowering colleagues with insights and improving patient outcomes through data-driven interventions. I completed my Data Science MSc at the University of Salford, where I am currently studying towards a PhD. The aim of my postgraduate research is to investigate spatiotemporal methods of predicting changes in health inequalities in communities in the Northwest of England.

Whilst working at the NHS Transformation Unit I have recently been working on pathway modelling, dashboard visualisation and population health analytics. If you'd like to see some of the work we've been engaged in recently, take a look at our [GitHub page](https://github.com/NHS-Transformation-Unit).

## 🔨 What I'm working on
 - **Statistical Analysis**: Using R to undertake analysis on a range of healthcare issues such as waiting times, demand and health inequalities. I enjoy using R to create interesting visualisations and methods for finding meaningful insights.
 - **Geospatial Analysis**: Employing geospatial data through tools such as QGIS and R to enable spatial insights in areas including population health and clinical service redesign.
 - **Pathway Simulation**: Creating simulations of patient pathways to help understand bottlenecks and predict the impact of service re-design on waiting times and patient outcomes.
 - **Dashboard and Report Creation**: Creating dashboards using Shiny and interactive reports in RMarkdown to provide decision-makers with engaging analysis.

## 🌱 What I'm currently learning
- **R**: Further enhancing my skills in R to allow for complex machine learning solutions and spatio-temporal analysis.
- **Python**: Developing my understanding of Python for data analysis and for machine learning.

## 📫 Get in Touch
I'm always interested in connecting with fellow healthcare analysts, data scientists or health researchers. Please drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliot-royle-ba58641b5/).
